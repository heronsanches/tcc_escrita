Many devices have been put on domestics environments through the Home Servers with the aim of automate the daily tasks of a smart home. But, some devices when alone do not attend the user specifications. Then, there is the needed to compose them to provide features that are accord to them specifications. When there is a device's composition, the behave of at least one of them can cause feature interactions with undesirable side effects. So, this work proposes detect undesirable side effects between devices using the ensemble DECORATE. For it propose was realized observations of the physical devices behave and the messages changed by these devices, which were made available how Web RESTFul services. Through the data collected was made a classification process and as the final result was obtained a model with more than 90\% of precision. It was put into FIM (Feature Interaction Manager) of the Home Network System (HNS), showing that is possible detect undesirable side effect between these devices.
