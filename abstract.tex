Many devices have been put on domestics environments through the Home Servers with the deal of automate the daily tasks of a smart home. These devices may be available how Web RESTFul services. But, some devices when alone do not attend the user specifications. Then, there is the need to composition with the other devices to provide features that are accord to them specifications. When there is a device's composition, the behave of at least one of them can cause feature interaction with undesirable side effects. So, this work proposes detect undesirable side effects between devices using the ensemble DECORATE. For it, was realized observation of the physical behave and the messages changed by these devices. Through the data collected was made a classification process and put a classifier into FIM (Feature Interaction Manager), showing that is possible detect undesirable side effect between devices.
